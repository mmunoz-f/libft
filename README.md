# libft

This is the first project we have to face in 42, it's a recopilation of util functions we will use in the future projects, as you can see many of these utilities can be found in standard C libraries.

This was one of my first projects so the code is not the best, also as students, we have to respect a norm to suit some prerequisites, the function should not have more than 25 lines, no more than 4 parameters, no ternarie allowed... etc.
